# MDX: content for kings and princesses

A âš¡ lighting talk given at JAMStack_conf London on July 9, 2019. View the [slides here](https://mdx-fairy-tale.developermode.com/).

The presentation is about using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown + JSX) to make JAMstack content more interactive. The presentations itself is built with MDX and [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck).
