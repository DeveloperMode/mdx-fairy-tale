## My kingdom for JSX in Markdown

# MDX

<Notes>
Today, I’m going to talk to you about MDX. MDX lets you put JSX components in your markdown documents, making the power of your whole JavaScript app accessible from your content. To show you how MDX can help JAMstack teams, I want to tell you a story. But since case studies can be kinda boring, I'll tell you a fairy tale instead. 

- slide is mdx, jsx in markdown, maybe show code

## Once upon a time...

<Notes>
Once upon a time, there was a king named King Markdown.

- show the castle slide
- fade in the once upon a time

<KingMarkdown />

<Notes>
King Markdown loved text-heavy, long-form content. Paragraph after paragraph, several sentences each.

The only gestures he knows are scrolling and turning pages.

He's so adamant about having his content his way that he surrounded the kingdom in the Great Wall of Text, even though pretty much everyone opposed it.
</Notes>

<PrincessJavaScript />

<Notes>
King Markdown has a daughter, Princess JSX (“jessiks”). Not a normal name but she’s not a normal princess.

She writes code and she loves to use different gestures to interact with her content; to tap, pinch, rotate, shake and swipe.

How'd she learn all that, growing up in side the great wall? One night she snuck out of the kingdom and visited other kingdoms where JAMstack developers live, discovering interactive data viz and visual storytelling. Ever since then, she has been tirelessly advocating to bring this kind of content into her own kingdom.

## Struggle

- princess vs. the king

<Notes>
So as you can imagine, there's been a lot of tension in the royal palace, similar to what some of you may have even seen in your content teams. The kingdom's content experts, the Royal Academy of Content, was struggling to please both king and princess.
</Notes>

## Royal Academy of Content

<Notes>
The academy's markdown authors wanted to make their content more interactive, but they didn't know how. "There's no way to handle events in markdown", they cried! The front-end engineers wanted to help, but they thought it would be dangerous to let the markdown authors put arbitrary JavaScript code in their documents.

## One day

- show the tweet

<Notes>
One day, one of the engineers at the Royal Academy of Content was browsing Twitter and saw a tweet about something called MDX. He read the blog post behind the tweet and knew he had to try it.
</Notes>

## The Kingdom Rejoices

<Notes>
He stayed up all night coding and built a prototype.

Both the engineers and the content authors fell in love with MDX and started to make content that everyone could enjoy, no matter their age or screen size. Because ratings were up, even the king was happy.

This new content takes full advantage of the people devices, letting them scroll and tap, pinch, rotate, shake, swipe, flip, rotate and more.
</Notes>

## Happy Ending

<Notes>
Don't you just love it when stories have a happy ending? I bet you're thinking, I want to see some of this MDX. This is a tech conference, I paid good money, I want to see some code. Do y'all want to see some code?

Ok let's do it. (Put on glasses). You can never be too careful when you look at your own JavaScript.

<KingMarkdown />

<Notes>
*point sceptre at screen*
*code shows*

A-ha! All along, King Markdown was just an JSX component, embedded in the markdown that I wrote my slides in. It's an interactive component because when I point at it, it triggers an event that shows us its code.

JSX components have props, of course, and we can change them using one of my props, this royal sceptre.

<KingMarkdown outfit="casual" />

<Notes>
*change slide, show different king image, then point at the king*

Now the King is in casual chic mode.

If we don't like that, we can
